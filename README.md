## Inspiration

Managing libraries in Javascript projects should be easier. I created this product because I came in contact with a some fairly new developers that didn't fully understand the command line so this tool was a welcome development in their quest for growth.

## How to

This application aims to provide a visual interface for developers to deal with packages in their projects. With this application you can manage multiple package.json files, view dependencies within them and update attached packages packages.

To get started, launch the application, click the **Select package file** button which launches a file select dialog. Pick your project's `package.json` file and you're good to go.

### Managing multiple projects.

Managing multiple `package.json` files is pretty simple, while viewing an open `package.json` file, click the back button and select another file, you can easily switch between projects on the applications landing page.

### Find releases for packages in your package.json file

This application displays the latest versions of each package within your project, to upgrade each package version, select the desired version from the versions dropdown beside each project.
