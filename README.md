## Why

Got tired of jumping to the terminal whenever I needed to update a bunch of packages within a project. I'm sure some of you can relate.

## How to

This application aims to provide a visual interface for developers to deal with packages in their projects. With this application you can manage multiple package.json files, view dependencies within them and update attached packages packages.

To get started, launch the application, click the **Select package file** button which launches a file select dialog. Pick your project's `package.json` file and you're good to go.

### Managing multiple projects

Managing multiple `package.json` files is pretty simple, while viewing an open `package.json` file, click the back button and select another file, you can easily switch between projects on the applications landing page.

### Find releases for packages in your package.json file

This application displays the latest versions of each package within your project, to upgrade each package version, select the desired version from the versions dropdown beside each project.

## Installation

Download the app from the [releases](https://github.com/hackafro/PackageManager/releases) page.

## OR

Clone the repository to your computer, build and run the project.

## New releases

For Windows users, you'll be notified whenever there's an update but unfortunately this doesn't apply on MacOS as the updater requires the application to be signed. The application hasn't been signed yet as it costs money to join the Apple developer program; until then you have to manually check for updates.

## Contributions

New ideas and features for the application are very welcome and contributions to close existing issues are also welcome. Clone the project to get started.

## License

Available under the MIT license.
